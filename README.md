In this project, I worked with the Cyclistic Bike-Share dataset from december 2022 to november 2023 following a structured approach aligning with the data analysis process which are: 
ASK, PREPAE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE and ACT.
The analysis is conducted using the R programming language, leveraging its capabilities in data cleaning, analysis and visualization.
The primary objective of this project is to strategize the conversion of casual riders into annual members.
